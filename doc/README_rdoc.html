		<h1><a href="Elo.html">Elo</a></h1>
<p>
From <a
href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elo_rating_system">Wikipedia</a>:
</p>
<p>
The <a href="Elo.html">Elo</a> rating system is a method for calculating
the relative skill levels of players in two-player games such as chess and
Go. It is named after its creator Arpad <a href="Elo.html">Elo</a>, a
Hungarian-born American physics professor.
</p>
<p>
The <a href="Elo.html">Elo</a> system was invented as an improved chess
rating system, but today it is also used in many other games. It is also
used as a rating system for multiplayer competition in a number of computer
games, and has been adapted to team sports including association football,
American college football and basketball, and Major League Baseball.
</p>
<h2>Links</h2>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://iain.github.com/elo/doc">API documentation</a>

</li>
<li><a href="http://github.com/iain/elo">Source Code</a>

</li>
</ul>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
You need to have at least to players that can play a game (duh).
</p>
<pre>
  bob  = Elo::Player.new
  jane = Elo::Player.new(:rating =&gt; 1500)
</pre>
<p>
Once you have players, you can register games in a variaty of ways. There
is more than one way to do it, choose whatever works from your other code:
</p>
<pre>
  game1 = bob.wins_from(jane)
  game2 = bob.loses_from(jane)
  game3 = bob.plays_draw(jane)

  game4 = bob.versus(jane)
  game4.winner = jane

  game5 = bob.versus(jane)
  game5.loser = jane

  game6 = bob.versus(jane)
  game6.draw

  game7 = bob.versus(jane)
  game7.result = 1 # result is in perspective of bob, so bob wins

  game8 = bob.versus(jane, :result =&gt; 0) # jane wins
</pre>
<p>
You can get all kinds of info from a player:
</p>
<pre>
  bob.rating       # =&gt; 1080
  bob.pro?         # =&gt; false
  bob.starter?     # =&gt; true
  bob.games_played # =&gt; 8
  bob.games        # =&gt; [ game1, game2, ... game8 ]
</pre>
<p>
Or get a list of players:
</p>
<pre>
  Elo::Player.all  # =&gt; [ bob, jane ]
  Elo::Game.all    # =&gt; [ game1, game2, ... game8 ]
</pre>
<h2>Configuration</h2>
<p>
You can configure <a href="Elo.html">Elo</a> in many ways. In it&#8217;s
default configuration, it is configured in the same way as the <a
href="http://www.fide.com/">FIDE</a> (World Chess Foundation).
</p>
<p>
Altering settings to your liking is very easy and very flexible. You can
even specify your own K-factor rules. Have a look at the Rdoc in the code
for a complete reference.
</p>
<p>
Here is an example:
</p>
<pre>
  Elo.configure do |config|

    # Every player starts with a rating of 1000
    config.default_rating = 1000

    # A player is considered a pro, when he/she has more than 2400 points
    config.pro_rating_boundry = 2400

    # A player is considered a new, when he/she has played less than 30 games
    config.starter_boundry = 30

  end
</pre>
<h2>About the K-factor</h2>
<p>
The <a href="Elo.html">Elo</a> rating system knows a variable called the
&#8220;K-factor&#8221;. The K-factor is used to reward new talent and
stableize the rating once a player is participating longer.
</p>
<p>
FIDE (the World Chess Foundation), gives players with less than 30 played
games a K-factor of 25. Normal players get a K-factor of 15 and pro&#8217;s
get a K-factor of 10. Once you reach a pro status, you&#8217;re K-factor
never changes, even if your rating drops.
</p>
<p>
You need to provide <a href="Elo.html">Elo</a> the amount of games played,
their rating and their pro-status.
</p>
<pre>
  bob = Elo::Player.new(:games_played =&gt; 29, :rating =&gt; 2399, :pro =&gt; true)
  bob.k_factor == 10
</pre>
<p>
You can define your own K-factors by adding K-factor rules. This code will
change the K-factor to 12, for every player that played less than 10 games,
and 16 for everybody else.
</p>
<pre>
  Elo.configure do |config|
    config.k_factor(12) { games_played &lt; 10 }
    config.default_k_factor = 16
    config.use_FIDE_settings = false
  end
</pre>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<pre>
  gem install elo
</pre>
<h2>Note on Patches/Pull Requests</h2>
<ul>
<li>Fork the project.

</li>
<li>Make your feature addition or bug fix.

</li>
<li>Add tests for it. This is important so I don&#8217;t break it in a future
version unintentionally.

</li>
<li>Commit, do not mess with rakefile, version, or history. (if you want to
have your own version, that is fine but bump version in a commit by itself
I can ignore when I pull)

</li>
<li>Send me a pull request. Bonus points for topic branches.
